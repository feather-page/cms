Feather-Page CMS is a Rails application that provides a web interface for managing small static websites.

## Design Goals

* A simple interface that can be used by non-technical users.
* Website should look like a real web-developer hand-coded them.
* Deployed websites should be static.
* Deployed websites should NOT load any external resources.
* Deployed websites should be as small as possible.
* Deployed websites should be SEO friendly.
* Deployed websites are on domains that belong to the user.
